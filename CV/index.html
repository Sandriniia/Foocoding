                <p class="header__info-text">My name is Sandra, I am from Russia. I moved to Sweden with my husband and daughter. I like Sweden, Swedish culture and attitude to life. I started learning programming while I was on maternity leave and still can't stop. I like to learn new things and grow, in programming also. Fortunately, there is always a lot to learn in development. I'm not afraid of mistakes, I like to find and correct them. I'm studying CSS and Java Script. My goal is to become a good web developer.
